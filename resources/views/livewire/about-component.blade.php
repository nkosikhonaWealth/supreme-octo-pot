Their biggest barrier is lack of resources to transform their idea into a thriving business. This group will be supported to move their concepts into viable business plans ready for financing, and then into the next stage of successful start-up and growth.</p>

Usually, this is due to a lack of formal qualifications, lack of practical skills training (e.g TVET), and a poor job market. This group will be supported through "experiential business" activities, which are low-risk enterprise often set-up as a group business with a small seed capital, to help the youth generate an income and improve their entrepreneurial skills.</p>

This group will be supported with mentorship and entrepreneurial kick start. Participants will be provided with platforms for youth collaboration, networking, and access to tendering and industry placement opportunities, particularly within government institutions. In entrepreneurial kick start, qualifying participants will undergo comprehensive training to prepare them for the entrepeneurship and they will be awarded starter kits (tools and machinery), so they can generate an income.</p>
